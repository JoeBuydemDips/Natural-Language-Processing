# All Things Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- This repository will house all things related to NLP and what you need to know to be instrumental.

# Text Preprocessing
- This folder will document and house the more important functionalities of NLP on how to:
  - Preprocess your Text
  - Functions that will help you preprocess
  - Customization of functions to get what you need

# Named Entity Recognition (NER)
I cover what an NER is and how to use this model! If you are interested in labeling documents without reading them, this might be the repository for you!
- Text classification and categorization
- Utilizes prebuilt models
- Depends on [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer)

# Sentiment Analysis
I cover sentiment analysis at a very high level, covering all the basics to get you started on your NLP journey! The twitter data can be retrieved [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/paoloripamonti/twitter-sentiment-analysis/output)
- Sentiment Analysis [**Youtube Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzRrD76pnVY)
- Preprocessing: Tokenization, Regex, Lemmatization, Stop Words
- Word2Vec
- Embedding Layer
- LSTM Classification

# Transformers
I cover the high level overview on the transformer architecture, covering all the logic and basics that go into the development of this state-of-the-art model. This model is the successor to popular models such as RNN, GRU, and LSTM's since transformers are easily parallelizeable and have greater understanding with context.

# BERT
I cover the high level overview on the architecture of BERT, building off of the transformer architecture, where I cover all the logic and basics that go into the development of such a model. In addition, I evaluate the pros and cons of BERT and LSTM, AND provide a code implementation with a sentiment analysis prompt.

# Question Answering (QA)
I cover the high level overview on the architecture of QA Models (based on BERT). I also go into depth on what QA Modeling is, how it can be applied, and how it is used in the real world. I also cover the  pretraining and fine-tuning phases of the QA Modeling process.
