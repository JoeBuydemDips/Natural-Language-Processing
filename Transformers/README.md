# Brief Explanations on Transformers
![Transformer](Transformer.png)
- The __Transformer__ model that predominatley replaced the [RNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBlPZJrJt9g), [GRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdz0UqQz5Sw), and [LSTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmxogwIjOhE) models due to efficacy and speed. (Links to videos on each of those topics have been covered on my YouTube Channel!
- Has the ability to take a more context (getting all the words instead of sequential, iterative input)
- Has the ability to highly parallelize the processes
- [Paper use-case](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) was Machine Translation, however, the transformer models (or derivations of) have been used in other cases
